entry point: server.js

put PORT in .env

#to connect backend with frontend we need to give proxy
- as both the server will be on different ports, it will give CORS error
- add proxy : http://127.0.0.1:5000 in frontend/package.json

For those getting proxy error, Try running this command in frontend
npm config set https-proxy http://127.0.0.1:5000

#put your Mongo_URI in .env

#In backend, config/db.js is responsible for DB connection

#As we are taking values from the frontend, make sure to use this in backend/server.js -> app.user(express.json())
